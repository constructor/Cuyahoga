**************************************************************
From version 1.5.0, Cuyahoga requires the .NET 2.0 Framework.
**************************************************************

Upgrading Cuyahoga

*****************************************************************************
Allways backup the database and the files on the server before upgrading!
*****************************************************************************

If you are running Cuyahoga 0.8.2 or higher, you can upgrade to a new version 
by copying the new web files over the old files. The first user who accesses 
the site after upgrading is redirected to the upgrade page after logging in 
as administrator. Other users see a message that the site is being upgraded.

The upgrade page is always accessible for administrators at 
CUYAHOGA_WEB_ROOT/Install/Upgrade.aspx. You might need that in case you get 
a message that the site is being upgraded while you are the person who is 
going to perform the upgrade.

Don't forget to check your modules for upgrades via the module administration!

*****************************************************************************
SPECIAL NOTE FOR USERS UPGRADING FROM 1.0.x to 1.5.0 AND NEWER:
*****************************************************************************
- From version 1.5, Cuyahoga needs the .NET 2.0 framework. Make sure it is
  installed and your website is set to use the 2.0 framework (via IIS 
  administration).
- Make a backup of your old web.config. The new installation contains a new
  web.config without database connection info that has moved to 
  /Config/properties.config.
- Edit /Config/properties.config and copy the database connection info 
  (connectionString, nhibernateDriver and nhibernateDialect) from the 
  old web.config.

*****************************************************************************
Upgrading from versions pre-0.8.2
*****************************************************************************
Users upgrading from a pre-0.8.2 version must first update the database to
the 0.8.2 version. Use the scripts in /Database directory. If you don't know
which version you are running, you can find it in the cuyahoga_version table.
If the cuyahoga_version table doesn't exist yet, check the properties of the
Cuyahoga.Core.dll assembly (version tab).
