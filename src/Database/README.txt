The database scripts in the this directory are replaced with scripts in the
/Install/../Database directories of Cuyahoga.Web and the modules. 

Only use these scripts to upgrade a pre-0.8.2 version of Cuyahoga to 0.8.2.
When the database is upgraded to 0.8.2, the installer takes over.

================

Added 20060917: For the Cuyahoga Alpha/Beta cycles, upgrading is not 
supported from the installer. Upgrade scripts are added here.
