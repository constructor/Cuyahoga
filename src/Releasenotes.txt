===========================================================================
1.0.0 - 2005-12-30
===========================================================================

- Search input module. A search input box that can be connected to the 
  existing search module. This module makes it possible to have a global
  search box with creating a section with this module and attaching the
  section to a template.
  
Improvements:
- Allow modules to insert their own stylesheets. 
  BREAKING CHANGE: In custom template controls 
    <link id="CssStyleSheet" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" runat="server" />
  must to be replaced with
    <asp:literal id="Stylesheets" runat="server" />.
- Added option to installer to create a basic sample site.
- It's possible to attach sections to templates from the section edit page.
- Better error messages in the module administration pages for StaticHtml
  and Articles.
- Added option in web.config to redirect to the login page when a user
  has no access to a particular node (also to prevent nasty error messages
  when a login session times out):
    <add setting="RedirectToLoginWhenAccessDenied" value="true" /> 
    <!-- true/false, customErrors must be enabled -->
- Upgraded to NHibernate 1.0.1.

Bugfixes:
- Fixed error message when sending an email fails during registration.
- Fixed confirmation messages while creating new users and nodes.
- Fixed issue with attaching a section to a node (search-related).

===========================================================================
0.9.1 - 2005-11-13
===========================================================================
New features:
- Module connections. A module can implement two interfaces, 
  IActionConsumer and IActionProvider. This allows connecting of different
  sections across pages.
- Sections in templates. Before, a section was always related to a node 
  (page) in the site hierarchy. From now, it's possible to define 
  stand-alone sections or detach existing sections from a node. When
  editing template properties, it's now possible to attach a stand-alone 
  section to a placeholder in the template. The section appears on every 
  page that uses the template.
  
Improvements:
- Upgraded to NHibernate 1.0.0.0.
- Removed special mapping files for Mono because dynamic proxies work on
  Mono.
- Removed references from the Web project to NHibernate.

Bugfixes:
- Nodes set to an external url, can be reverted back to 'normal' nodes.
- Fixed issue with empty custom menus that caused an exception.

===========================================================================
0.9.0 - 2005-10-05
===========================================================================
New features:
- Added a web based installer that installs or upgrades the database at the
  first run.
- Added a module installer. If a module has a specific directory structure
  with database scripts, you can now install, upgrade or uninstall modules
  from the site administration.

Improvements:
- Support for .NET 2.0 and SQL Server 2005
- The User module can be configured to show or hide links to registration,
  reset password and edit profile pages.
- The RemoteContent module is able to read feeds that have dates that 
  differ slightly from the format that .NET accepts.
- It is possible to show the number of downloads to end-users.
- Better error handling with invalid urls.
- Added sort options for Articles.
- Navigating from the site administration to the actual site and 
  vice-versa is much improved.
- When omitting publishing dates for articles, default dates are issued.
- Cleaned up database installation scripts.
- Upgraded NHibernate to 1.0 RC3.
- Upgraded FCKEditor to 2.0.

Bug fixes:
- Fixed issues with stalling downloads in the Downloads module. Resuming
  downloads is also supported now.

  Danzl.
- Fixed bug with nodes that link to external pages where the target setting
  was not respected.
- Fixed bug with pager control in the Articles module administration.
- The RSS feeds now validate in the feed validator.
- Fixed issue in the RemoteContent module with feed items without
  publication dates.
- Fixed issues with node and section positioning.
- Fixed some issues with the calendar control and non-english languages.
  There might still be some issues left because the language scripts that
  come with the calendar are not entirely complete for every language.

===========================================================================
0.8.2 - 2005-07-20
===========================================================================
Improvements:
- Added support for alternative urls (https, different ports). Thanks to
  Tomislav Tustonic for the heads up.
- A node can now serve as a link to an external page or site.

Bugfixes:
- Fixed issues with NHibernate second level cache that caused a nasty delay
  when adding or removing nodes and sections.

===========================================================================
0.8.1 - 2005-06-29
===========================================================================
Improvements:
- The downloads module is a little more user-friendly.
- Overall stability is increased due to testing under heavy load.

Bugfixes:
- Attaching multiple NHibernate sessions to the same object or collection
  causes an exception.
- If the first request after a server restart is an RSS feed, an exception
  is thrown at this first request.
- Displaying unknown filetypes in the Downloads module fails.
- The order of the files in the Downloads module changes after downloading
  a file.
- RSS feed failure on Mono.

===========================================================================
0.8.0 - 2005-06-11
===========================================================================
New features:
- RemoteContent module. This module consumes external RSS feeds and 
  displays the content. Currently only RSS 2.0 is supported.
- Downloads module. Publish files on the web site that are available as
  download for site visitors. The permissions (allowed roles) can be set
  per file.
- Timezone support for logged-in users. All display dates are adjusted to
  the timezone of the user.
  
Improvements:
- Friendly readable urls (configurable per site).
- Security settings of nodes can be propagated to child nodes and sections.
- Allow persisten logins.

Bugfixes:
- Edit hyperlinks show up when the user only has view access.
- Deleting nodes fails when they are in a custom menu.
- Removing nodes leaves the order of the nodes in an inconsistent state. 


===========================================================================
0.7.0.1 - 2005-04-04
===========================================================================
- Fixed bug when registering a new user (LastLogin should be NULL, but was 
  DateTime.MinValue).
- Fixed bug in PostgreSQL create script (showtitle in section).


===========================================================================
0.7.0 - 2005-03-29
===========================================================================
New features:

- Custom menus. You can now add custom menu's to every placeholder in the 
  template. The menu items point to existing nodes in the site. Visibility
  of nodes in the regular navigation/menu's can be turned off.
- Site aliases. A site has a default url that consists of the host and the 
  application name. A new feature was added to map alternative url's to the
  site, or a specific node in the site.

Improvements:
- All related template controls, stylesheets and images  are 
  now grouped in subdirectories in the Templates directory. The default 
  installation comes with two subdirectories, 'Default' and 'Classic'. Css 
  files always have to be in the Css subdirectory (for example, 
  'Templates/Default/Css').
  BREAKING CHANGE FOR EXISTING USERS: The path of the Template controls
  is now split into a base path (for example 'Templates/Default') and the 
  name of the template control ('CuyahogaNew.ascx'). After upgrading, 
  reorganize your physical files just like the default files and then go
  to the template adminstration and correct the values for the base path,
  template control and css.
- Templates can be changed any time now, even if there are sections 
  attached. Cuyahoga displays a warning when sections belong to a
  placeholder that is not found in the selected template.
- Support for MySQL 4.0 (was 4.1 and above).
- The site url doesn't care anymore about casing or trailing slashes.
  
Bugfixes:
- When there are ModuleSettings in the database that can not be found as
  a type, Cuyhoga throws an exception instead of returning null (and 
  causing a lot of misunderstanding).
- The calendar control now handles all regional settings for dates.
- Converted all table and column names to lowercase, because of errors
  with MySQL on Linux. It's more consistent now too.
  
Thanks to Ayende Rahien, Richard Bourque and sleuth for the heads up.
